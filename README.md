Types of Games: 
rock paper scissors
snake game 
tic tak toe
<!-- memory card game (pokemon api?) -->
something along the lines of the horse bet game 

Decision: 
Memory card game 

Requirements - win/lose? 
have a limited amount of flips per turn 
- which means i have to set up a conditional that limits it to 3 plays 
- things to look up-- I need to figure out how to set the limit to 3-5 turns, before triggering the YOU LOSE (bonus for me if i can add un a sound or gif of pikachu shaking his head)
- then, giving a pop up that says you lose

Things that I need: 
+ assets 
    - pictures for the card 
    - figuring out the pictures under the card
    - pikachu - figure out how to add the gif / if not use the image
